parts and limiting the production of bad parts.\nCan data be used to learn how to make more good parts and fewer bad parts?\nAs a data science intern at EWI, I helped develop and implement a Bayesian model for car door manufacturing during the summer of 2021.\n\nI also wrote a paper about this work, which became an open access and peer-reviewed publication: Profit-Driven Methodology for Servo Press Motion Selection under Material Variability.\nThis page provides a high-level overview of the work behind that paper.\nBusiness Problem\nThe business objective was to make the most money.\nMaking more good parts means making more money.\nOn the other hand, making bad parts costs money.\nSo making the most money is a matter of making the most number of good parts and the least number of bad parts.\nMathematically we can represent this relationship as:\n$$\\text{Profit} = 3 g - 2 b$$\nwhere \\(g\\) is the number of good parts produced\nand \\(b\\) is the number of bad parts produced.\nWe assumed that each good part had a value of 3 USD and each bad part cost 2 USD.\nThis mathematical formulation shows that profit increases as we make more good parts but decreases as we make more bad parts.\nData Collection\nWhen manufacturing a car door, a piece of sheet metal gets formed into shape by a press.\nFirst, the sheet gets placed on a bottom component.\nThen, a top component comes down on top of the sheet, pressing it into the shape it's supposed to be.\nEssentially, the press is hitting the sheet so that it bends into the correct shape.\nVariability creeps into this process through (1) the material properties of the input sheet metal and (2) the type of motion utilized by the press to form the sheet metal.\nAs an example of a material property, stiff metal needs a lot more force to bend correctly.\nNot enough force results in a part that isn't shaped correctly.\nHowever, exerting more force on the metal increases the likelihood for breaking the part.\nAs for motion, think of the options available for how the bottom and top components interact in relation to each other.\nThe bottom component might give a little or stay rigidly in place.\nThe top component might come down quickly or slowly.\nOur metal forming process expert had already collected data for car door manufacturing from an earlier project.\nAt the time, he was investigating which press motion parameters tended to yield good parts from a process engineering perspective.\nThe data contained material property measurements for the sheet metal, the press motion parameters, and the outcome.\nThe original data was nicely cleaned for me by the time I was working on the project.\nModel Selection\nMy team decided that it would be best to build a predictive model that could tell us how likely it would be for a part to turn out good, based on the material properties of the input sheet metal and the press motion.\nWe chose to simplify the outcome observations to two cases only (good or bad), so we wanted a binary classifier.\nFinally, since my team had been recently studying probabilistic graphical modeling, we decided to implement Bayesian Logistic Regression.\nThe Bayesian formulation also allowed us to see how uncertain the model was about its prediction of the likelihood of a good outcome.\nInsights\nOnce we had trained our model,\nwe could apply expected utility theory to see how many good pieces we could expect to get out of each motion for a given input.\nWe ran a simulation 1000 times to calculate expected returns for a few different strategies.\nSurprisingly, choosing to always run the a priori best motion took second place to a more sophisticated strategy.\nThe winning strategy would halt production if no motion was likely to yield good parts.\nIn other words, the winning strategy refused to produce parts if it expected that it would produce too many bad parts.\nFurthermore, the winning strategy sometimes chose to produce parts using a motion with a lower rate of success.\nWhile this may seem counterintuitive at first, this makes sense when realizing that the a priori best motion took longer to execute than the other motions.\nThis meant that expected utility theory could tell us when it would be more profitable to produce more parts with a lower rate of success than fewer parts with a higher rate of success.\nFurther details on what we did and what we learned is available in our open access and peer-reviewed publication, Profit-Driven Methodology for Servo Press Motion Selection under Material Variability.\nRetrospective\nIt was fun applying my Bayesian statistics and Monte Carlo sampling knowledge in a business setting.\nI had studied these topics as a computer science graduate student, and I got to make use of them outside of the classroom.\nI implemented the model in Python using the PyMC3 library on a Windows machine.\nThe work was saved to a private GitHub repository owned by the company.\nOne detail I learned through this project is the difficulty of properly sampling from a statistical model that includes a latent categorical distribution.\nOne iteration of our model included a latent categorical distribution to account for the different motion types.\nIn general, latent categorical distributions cause the posterior distributions to take on a funnel shape, which was very hard for the sampling technology to sample from.\nOne solution to this sampling problem is to marginalize out the latent categorical distribution.\nSince my team was interested in differentiating performance between motion types, this solution was not acceptable.\nInstead, we trained one Bayesian Logistic Regression for each motion type, training each one using only the data from the corresponding motion type.\nOf course, this work wouldn't have been possible without the support of many people,\nespecially those listed as authors on the paper.\nThe publication itself also required generous support (both editorial as well as financial) from key staff within EWI.\n","id":"https://nOkuda.github.io/car-doors/","title":"Car Doors, Random Sampling, and Profit"},"https://nOkuda.github.io/ct-scanning/":{"body":"How can a team write software in a way that helps them explore a research question?\nAs an intern at Buffalo Manufacturing Works in the summer of 2018 (this company would later officially rebrand as the Buffalo office of EWI),\nI had the opportunity to help my team research new methods for industrial CT scanning.\n\nAs a result of my contributions, I had the honor of getting my name on the patent that resulted from this project (Computed tomography for non-destructive evaluation of manufactured parts, US10969771B2).\nBusiness Motivation\nCT scans are probably most familiar from the medical field, where you might stand or lay down in a contraption that moves around you to take x-ray images of your body.\nDoctors can use the results of a CT scan to predict damage to your internal organs and prescribe appropriate measures to help you heal.\nIn an industrial setting, CT scans serve a similar function.\nA manufactured part undergoes a CT scan, and a technician or engineer interprets the results to predict faults in the part.\nCT scanners work by taking multiple x-ray images around a particular object.\nUsing some math, the images can be used to reconstruct a 3D model of the object.\nThe off-the-shelf solutions for industrial CT scanning used one method of 3D reconstruction that required taking many x-ray images.\nBuffalo Manufacturing Works, as contracted by a certain client, investigated a different 3D reconstruction technique that required fewer x-ray images but more computing power.\nThe idea was that the usual method took a long time because of the number of images it needed to make a good reconstruction,\nbut the method we were investigating could potentially take a shorter period of time because fewer images would be required.\nWhile the new method would take more computational time to provide a reconstruction of similar quality,\nthe hypothesis was that it would still take less time in total using the new method than the old.\nSoftware Development Practices\nTo help the project in investigating new methods for 3D reconstruction from CT scans,\nI shared my knowledge of version control (git) and unit testing (pytest).\nMy knowledge of Python programming was also stronger than my co-workers',\nso I got to coach them in that area as well.\nFinally, I shared with them my knowledge of the process of code reviews and pull requests.\nProud Moments\nBesides helping my team build and maintain a code repository, I got to do some deeper technical work on the project.\nOne of my contributions was applying the image processing technique of watershedding to the 3D reconstruction algorithm.\nWe were having trouble reconstructing a sharp distinction between object and non-object,\nand I remembered watershedding from my image processing class.\nWatershedding is an algorithm that analyzes an image to find segments within it.\nBy applying watershedding to the x-ray images, I was able to get a sharper distinction between object and non-object in the reconstruction.\nAnother contribution I made was utilizing the ASTRA toolbox to run the computations on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).\nWe were already using the ASTRA toolbox to run our computations on a GPU,\nbut we were running into out-of-memory errors as we increased the resolution of our reconstruction.\nOur mathematics expert noted that the method we were working with could conceivably be decomposed into sub-problems that would fit onto the GPU memory,\nbut we weren't sure how much effort it would take to implement that solution.\nNear the end of my time working on this project, I dove deep into the ASTRA toolbox documentation and found code that suggested that the sub-problem decomposition had already been implemented in that library.\nAfter a few failed attempts, I finally got ASTRA toolbox to work as I wished, demonstrating that the reconstruction that originally could only fit on the large GPU in our workstation could be solved on my laptop's GPU, which had many times less memory.\nPerhaps the most prominent legacy of this work is resulting the patent.\nMy co-workers felt grateful enough for my contributions that they even included me as an author on it.\nRetrospective\nIn some ways, it is a miracle that I was trusted with such a large responsibility on this project.\nMy software engineering experience out in industry was limited to a few months as an intern at one company a few years previous.\nI may have had help from other contributors in some of my past code projects, but those projects were largely individual efforts.\nAlso, I don't think I had ever worked on a project that brought in so much money.\nI got to do another internship with the company again three years later,\nand my previous co-workers excitedly showed me how they were still using the software development techniques I had taught them.\nI was glad to see that (1) they appreciated what I did and (2) what I taught them was serving them well.\n","id":"https://nOkuda.github.io/ct-scanning/","title":"Software Development for CT Scanning Research"},"https://nOkuda.github.io/masters-thesis/":{"body":"Suppose that you have a large set of unlabeled text data.\nAssuming you have limited time to label the data, which subset of the data should you label to get the best machine learning model?\nAnd what order should that subset be labeled in?\nThese were the questions I worked on for my master's thesis, which I completed in the summer of 2017.\n\nThe thesis is available for download.\nThe code used to collect and analyze the data discussed in the thesis is available on GitHub.\nProblem\nSometimes, you have a lot of text data on hand that might give you important insights if you could organize them into categories.\nMaybe you have a bunch of opinions submitted regarding a proposed policy change, and you'd like to see how supported the policy change is.\nOr maybe you've been given a collection of leaked e-mail messages that may or may not have contained government secrets, and you'd like to know which government secrets were leaked.\nYou could meticulously label all of the documents, one by one, but that could be tedious and time-consuming.\nThis would be especially problematic if you had a deadline for when you needed to have drawn insights from the documents.\nThe strategy I explored in my master's thesis was training a supervised machine learning algorithm on a subset of the documents.\nThe open question for this strategy is to decide which subset of the documents should be labeled to produce the best model within an allotted time.\nFurthermore, once we know which subset to label, we would like to know what order we should have humans label the documents.\nData Selection\nWhile my thesis works with a few data sets, the one data set that gets used throughout the thesis is a set of Amazon product reviews.\nThese product reviews contain (1) text data that the reviewer has written about a product and (2) a numerical rating from one to five indicating how highly the reviewer rated the product.\nEach review serves as a document, and the associated rating serves as the document's true label.\nThis allowed me to use the data set for supervised machine learning.\nIn my thesis, I tried converting the text data into a few different modifications of features known as \"topics\", as defined by the field of topic modeling.\nTopic modeling is an unsupervised technique for learning word distributions present in a set of documents.\nEach topic is a particular probabilistic distribution of words, and there is an algorithm for inferring the distribution of topics in each document.\nDocument Selection for Labeling\nTo determine which subset of the data should be labeled, I ran simulation experiments measuring the predictive \\(R^2\\) of the supervised anchor words model as I expanded the set of labeled documents.\nIn addition to predictive \\(R^2\\), I measured how long each selection method took.\nThe workflow for each simulation was as follows:\n\nstart with 20 documents in the \"labeled\" pile (act as if all other documents are unlabeled)\nuntil 300 documents are labeled:\n\ntrain a model on the labeled documents\ncompute the next document to add to the labeled pile\nreveal the label of the chosen document and add it to the labeled pile\n\n\n\nThe code I used to run these experiments is available on GitHub.\nOf the three document selection methods tested, random selection seemed best.\nFor the most part, random selection seemed to improve model performance about as efficiently or more efficiently than the other selection methods.\nMoreover, random selection was clearly the fastest selection method.\nThis is an important point, since faster selection of next document to label means more labeled documents for an allotted amount of labeling time.\nContext Switching Effect\nKnowing that labeling a random subset of documents is the most efficient way to train a supervised model, the next question to answer is what order those documents should be labeled.\nTo answer this question, I devised and ran a user study that measured the time humans took to label documents presented in a particular order.\nIn the user study, participants saw the text of an Amazon review one by one and had the task of labeling the text with the rating they thought corresponded with the text.\nUnbeknownst to the participants, the Amazon reviews were in a particular order.\nUsing topic modeling, I organized reviews by their most prevalent topic, and the participants would label 16 documents in a row with the same most prevalent topic.\nThe next 16 documents would then have a different most prevalent topic.\nThis pattern would continue until participants had completed labeling five such 16-document groups.\nWe can refer to these 16-document groups as \"topic groups\".\nEvery participant's set of documents to label was randomly generated at the time of the study, and the amount of time each took to label the documents was recorded.\nThe hypothesis was that forcing humans to make a context switch from a group of documents with one most prevalent topic to a group of documents with a different most prevalent topic would increase labeling time of the first document of the set.\nI implemented the backend code for the user study using Python and Flask.\nA labmate helped me implement the frontend display for the participants in Javascript.\nOur work is available on GitHub.\nUsing the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, I showed that the labeling time of the first document of each topic group took longer than labeling the seventh and later documents of the same topic group.\nThis suggests that context switching really does cause an increase in document labeling time.\nTo definitively show that reducing context switching would lead to faster document labeling times, I devised and ran a second user study.\nThis time, each participant received two treatments, one immediately after the other.\nOne treatment was to see the documents in random order.\nThe other treatment was to see documents by topic groups.\nWhich treatment came first for each participant was randomly determined.\nIn analyzing the data collected from this second user study, I resorted once more to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and found that random labeling order tended to have longer labeling times than labeling by topic groups.\nWhile paired t-test seemed like the obvious analysis to perform on this data, I found through the Shapiro-Wilk test that neither random labeling times nor topic-ordered labeling times were normally distributed, meaning that an assumption of the paired t-test was violated.\nTherefore, I conducted the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test in place of the paired t-test.\nInsights\nUsing the data I had collected, I concluded that the best way to label a set of documents is to\n(1) randomly choose as large a subset as you can afford and\n(2) show the documents by topic groups.\nFurthermore, the data I collected demonstrated that the average labeling time of documents shown by topic group is about 13% less than the average labeling time of documents shown in random order.\nEven if the models I worked with have now fallen out of favor, these conclusions about how to label your text data can be applied to any model that requires labeled documents.\nSo the next time you have a team of labelers and a stack of documents to label, keeping these points in mind might help you.\nRetrospective\nThe experience of my master's degree in computer science, culminating as it did in my thesis, has taught me the importance of trusting others.\nOr rather, reflecting on the experience has since brought me to this realization.\nAfter my committee had already approved my thesis, I was reviewing it one last time before submitting it for archiving.\nThat evening, I thought I saw a mistake and made a change I thought would correct it.\nLater on, I discovered that my change had actually introduced an error, and so you can still find in the archived version of my thesis a division that does not make sense.\nLuckily, the final value I asserted was correct; but I swapped the divisor and dividend in my explanation for how I calculated the value.\nIf I had trusted my committee to find and notify me of the mistake I had imagined, I would not have made the change, and my thesis would have remained correct.\nAnother example of the importance of trusting others came from an important lesson my advisor taught me.\nI came into his office as usual to a weekly meeting with him, and we were reviewing comments he had made on the draft of my thesis.\nAs he gave me feedback, I zealously defended the choices I had made.\nThe defensive nature of my reaction was forceful enough that he stopped his feedback on my thesis for a moment and pointed out (with some exasperation, as I recall) that he was making suggestions to help improve my work.\nThat bit of wisdom changed my perspective.\nBefore, I had imagined that negative comments on my work were marks against me, tallied up to hurt me.\nFrom that perspective, of course I would endeavor to invalidate comments meant to hurt me.\nI have since come to see the importance of being more considerate of the people making comments about my work.\nThey are not all attacking me, and some of them might even be sharing helpful information.\nI really appreciate that lesson my advisor took the time to help me learn.\n","id":"https://nOkuda.github.io/masters-thesis/","title":"Labeling Data for the Best Model"},"https://nOkuda.github.io/participation-tracker/":{"body":"Teaching is not an easy task, and keeping track of student participation while teaching can be difficult.\nI decided to apply my software development skills and become more familiar with SQL to help me keep track of student participation for a class I taught during the Fall 2021 semester.\nProblem\nWhile pondering how I could determine whether a student understood the material I was teaching,\nit occurred to me that the best way to do so is to directly ask the student to demonstrate understanding.\nI wasn't interested in traditional forms of evaluation, like tests and quizzes in class.\nAs part of an alternative evaluation strategy, I decided that calling on students in class would be useful.\nThis seemed possible, since my class consisted of about a dozen students.\nI also decided that calling on students in a random order would give them ample opportunity to demonstrate their understanding.\nCalling on students in random order isn't too difficult to do manually with slips of paper and a container.\nBut I wanted a more streamlined system to record student participation and to update their grades conveniently.\nAnd so I dreamed up a software application to do the following:\n\nhelp me choose a student to call on\nrecord a category for which the student was being called on\nkeep track of points the student had earned\nallow for making up points a student had missed in case of excused absence\nexport the data in a format that I could import into the gradebook application\n\nSolution\nMy solution is participation-tracker (https://github.com/nOkuda/participation-tracker), a Rust application with a text user interface.\n(The version I've actually been working with and using is stored in a private repository, just in case I've accidentally leaked student data into a commit.)\nThe project structure follows the standard produced by cargo.\nCode Architecture\nThe code is architected with three major interfaces: with the user, with the database, and with the gradebook.\nThe user interface (code in src/front.rs) uses the cursive library to display information and options in the terminal.\nThe database interface (code in src/back.rs) interacts with the PostgreSQL database where student information is stored.\nThe gradebook interface (code in src/gate.rs) deals with the .tsv files that the gradebook application I was using could generate and ingest.\nThe application starts in src/main.rs, where command line parameters are read in order to determine what to do.\nIf a gradebook file is given, the application will update the database with new students on the roster and set students no longer on the roster to a \"dropped\" status.\nIt then loads the user interface, which allows for doing one of the following:\n\nrecord student participation\nexport student points\nupdate student points\nexit the program\n\nMost of the time, I'm using the application to record student participation.\nIn this mode, there are four columns.\nThe first column allows for selection of a student.\nIf the input is empty and I hit \"Enter\", the field will be randomly populated with a student's name.\nOtherwise, if I want to select a particular student, I can begin typing a name and then press \"Tab\" to autocomplete it (thanks to the fuzzy matching algorithm of fuzzy-matcher).\nThe second column allows for selection of a category for which the student is being called.\nThe third column allows for indicating whether the student's participation was satisfactory or not.\nA final column allows for saving the information input into the previous three columns into the database.\nWhen exporting student points, the application queries the database and saves out a .tsv file of the total points each student has earned within three pre-defined periods of time\n(the periods of time were separated based on exam days).\nThe .tsv file was formatted so that I could upload the file to the gradebook application, which would automatically update student participation scores.\nUpdating student points allowed for selecting a particular date and seeing all of the times a particular student was called on that day.\nThis was helpful when a student had missed class for an excusable reason and wanted to make up participation points.\nSince the application would choose students at random even when they were absent, I recorded absent student participation as unsatisfactory and moved on to another student.\nWhen a student then wished to make up participation points from an absence, I could look up how many times the student had been selected on that day of absence and provide opportunities to demonstrate understanding based on the categories recorded in each entry.\nOnce the student had demonstrated understanding, I could update that entry to have a satisfactory status, thereby increasing the participation points belonging to that student.\nDatabase Schema\nThe database includes the following tables:\n\nstudents\nstatuses\nhistory\ncategories\n\nThe students table contains information about students in the class.\nIt acts as the class roster and provides the unique identifiers other tables use as foreign keys to associate data with specific students.\nThe statuses table indicates what status a student is in (active, dropped, etc.)\nThis information would be used when generating the gradebook entries so that only active students would be included in the report.\nThe history table keeps track of which students have been chosen so far, when they were chosen, what they were chosen for, and whether they earned a point.\nThis is the table that contains individual events from which student participation points can be calculated.\nThe categories table indicates what category a point was earned for (homework answer, question, class participation, etc.)\nFurther details can be found in the README of the code repository: https://github.com/nOkuda/participation-tracker.\nRetrospective\nThis was the first project in which I worked with PostgreSQL.\nThe experience was generally pleasant.\nI found the PostgreSQL documentation easy to read and understand.\nAny time I had a question about how to write a particular query, simply reading the manual answered my questions.\nThis was also the first time that I had to alter tables in a SQL database.\nI had made a mistake earlier in the way I had stored student information.\nThis caused automatic gradebook updates to fail.\nIn order to provide the correct information for gradebook ingestion, I needed to add a column to the students database.\nAgain, the PostgreSQL manual was clearly written, and I had minimal struggles in getting the database to do what I needed it to do.\nAnother first: working with Rust's Arc structs.\nI had started writing the code so that functions took references to objects,\nbut that quickly led to compiler errors when I attempted to access these objects in cursive,\nwhich relies heavily on closures.\nSince closures can outlive the functions in which they are defined, the Rust compiler complained that the object references may not be valid by the time the closure was called.\nMaybe if I knew more Rust, I could have found a better way to assure the compiler that the objects would be alive at the time of the closure calls.\nBut the beginning of the semester was fast approaching, and I needed the program to work, so I used Arcs.\nOne thing I might change in the future are the hardcoded dates used for aggregating participation points by period.\nA configuration file approach would likely be more amenable to the flexibility needed when the program is run for a new semester, for example.\n","id":"https://nOkuda.github.io/participation-tracker/","title":"Student Participation Tracker"},"https://nOkuda.github.io/tesserae/":{"body":"Tesserae is a software tool for finding intertexts between works of literature, primarily in Latin and ancient Greek.\nWorking on this open source project, both in paid an unpaid positions, gave me many opportunities to practice software development.\nOverview\nThe Tesserae project develops computational tools to find intertexts between works of literature.\nFor those unfamiliar with the term \"intertext\", it is a pair of literary passages such that one passage can cause readers to recall the other one.\nThe term \"allusion\" is probably better known, though scholars today tend to frown upon its use.\nThe Tesserae website makes Tesserae's intertext finding results available to scholars who study Latin and ancient Greek literature.\nThe intertext finding algorithm, commonly referred to as \"Tesserae search\", looks for matching words between two passages and then scores that pairing of passages based on the matching words.\nThe rarer the matching words and the closer together the matching words are located in the two passages, the higher the score.\nFurther details on Tesserae's methods are explained in Forstall et al. (2015) Modeling the scholars: Detecting intertextuality through enhanced word-level n-gram matching (Preprint).\nOf significance is that this project has been directed primarily by academics in the humanities.\nBecause of my interest in both programming and Latin, the Tesserae Project was, in many ways, the perfect project for me to become involved with.\nBeginnings\nMy initial dealings with the members of the Tesserae Project began near the end of my time working on a master's degree in computer science.\nI had reached out to a researcher about getting access to a data set he had, and he replied with, among other things, encouragement to look into the Tesserae Project.\nHe had, in fact, previously been a key member of the Tesserae Project before starting on his own path.\nThat initial encouragement eventually led me to join the Tesserae Project as a volunteer in August 2017 (also coinciding with when I started my PhD program in Classics at the University at Buffalo).\nAt that time, Tesserae was written in Perl.\nThe website used CGI to pass user-selected parameters to the Perl code, which then proceeded to run Tesserae search.\nThis would first read in previously serialized information from disk, look up matching word information, and score the paired passages.\nResults were then serialized back to disk and displayed to the user in pages.\nThe Perl code (old site) was adequate but lacked some nicer features.\nPerhaps the most difficult code to understand was the most critical: the part that computed the results.\nThe main body of the code takes up several hundred lines of bookkeeping on data structures created from a completely different script, the text ingestion script.\nA few subroutines had thankfully shortened the main body, but even these subroutines required an intimate knowledge of the data structures serialized by the text ingestion script.\nFrom a software engineering perspective, there were many aspects of this code that could be improved.\nIn my first months as a volunteer, I was tasked with investigating options for replacing the Perl code.\nAn earlier discarded version of the software was available, and I was asked to see whether it could be adapted to the present needs of the project.\nIt was a code base utilizing the Solr text search software, with a custom Scala plugin to perform Tesserae scoring.\nThe website was built in Django, and Celery was used to pass information between Solr and Django.\nThe installation was relatively easy, thanks to a Vagrant image, and it appears that I spent a little time working on making fixes, but I had difficulty imagining this code base to be understandable to a typical humanities graduate student.\nI recommended that this version remain discarded and that a new version be built in Python to attract more contributors.\nMentoring\nCoinciding with my first months on the Tesserae project, I met other students interested in the project as well.\nThere was a particular group of four of them (all graduate students from the Linguistics department) with whom I met every week to discuss the project.\nAs, at that time, I was much stronger in coding ability than they were, I attempted to share my coding knowledge with them at those weekly meetings.\nIn addition to helping them learn Python, I introduced them to working with git and GitHub.\nBy the end of that first semester, we had cobbled together a minimally working Python version of the software.\nAlthough that code was never officially adopted by the Tesserae project, I think that all of us volunteers came away from the experience with valuable lessons.\nSome of that group found that they did not want to code; others took that initial experience with Python and continued honing those skills in other projects.\nI myself came away with more ideas about how I could change the structure of the Perl code.\nIn fact, I went on to write experimental versions of the code in C++ and then in Javascript to work through ideas about how to organize the code.\nAt a later time, I taught an unofficial weekly Python course for humanities students.\nA volunteer in the Tesserae project was interested to see what it was like coding in Python, so she organized a group of similarly interested students, scheduled a room for us to meet in, and asked me to share my knowledge.\nI was happy to do so, and I enjoyed the experience.\nWhen the professor in charge of the Tesserae project asked for my opinion on who should be the Tesserae Fellow (i.e., the graduate student in charge of the day to day operations of the project) for the next school year, I was able to recommend the volunteer who had organized the unofficial course, citing her previous involvement with the project as well as her motivation in organizing the course.\nShe did, in fact, become the next Tesserae Fellow and fulfilled her duties well.\nI had the opportunity to mentor one more group of volunteers --- another two graduate students from Linguistics.\nOne was already proficient in coding, and the other learned over time; neither had worked on code collaboratively before.\nI guided both through setting up development environments and becoming familiar with git and GitHub.\nUpdating the Code\nIn 2018, the Tesserae Project won a research grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to make the Tesserae software easier to integrate with other digital humanities tools.\nI was the one person selected from my school to be funded through this two-year grant; another graduate student from the collaborating school, likewise receiving funding, worked with me to fulfill the promises made in the grant application.\nAlthough I was more familiar with the old code and had already drawn up some ideas for improving it, the other student was given the responsibility of architecting and implementing the new backend.\nI was instead tasked with designing and developing a REST API through which other software could access Tesserae's functionality.\nI spent much of my time on the project that first year of funding learning about REST and Web APIs.\nAs the second year began, the Python backend code was beginning to take solid enough shape that I could begin directly calling it in the API code I had mocked.\nSoon, the backend concerns became more of my responsibility as my teammate took on responsibility for the frontend.\nDuring this time, I improved the speed of some parts of the code, particularly in the calls made to the database (MongoDB), the database queries, and the post-processing code.\nThis was accomplished largely through carefully planned automated tests as well as measuring results with a profiler.\nI also worked with the system administrator to deploy the API and backend code.\nREST API\nAs mentioned above, my main responsibility was designing and implementing a REST API for Tesserae.\nThe main capabilities of Tesserae made available through the API are\n\nTesserae's catalog of texts\nRecommendations for words to ignore in the texts (i.e., stopwords), as calculated by word frequencies\nTesserae search as a service\nResults from a Tesserae search\n\nFor those interested in futher details, the documentation\nand the code are available.\nThe most difficult part of designing the REST API was fitting Tesserae search into a RESTful pattern.\nBecause Tesserae search requires a fair bit of computation, it was unrealistic to expect a response from the API server within a minute for all search queries.\nMy solution was to introduce an intermediate step between submitting a search request and retrieving the search results.\nThis was implemented by creating an identifier for each search request; that identifier would be used to retrieve the corresponding results.\nIf the identifier is used before the results are ready, the API responds so; otherwise, the API responds with the first page of results.\nImplementing this two-step process also required implementing a simple asynchronous / multiprocessing work queue (in the style of a solution to the producer-consumer problem).\nWhen the API receives a search request, it queries the backend to see if a search with the exact same parameters is already in the database.\nIf so, the API responds to the client with the identifier of the matching search already in the database.\nOtherwise, the API receives a new identifier from the backend, pushes the identifier and the search request onto the queue, and responds to the client with the new identifier.\nWhen the backend is ready to run search, it takes the first job off of the queue and performs the search requested.\nDesktop Application\nOne promise made in the project's grant proposal was to make the Tesserae software available as a desktop application.\nThis is desirable, for example, when a scholar is working with texts that are not allowed to be published yet.\nIn this case, the Tesserae project cannot host the texts on the public database, so it would be better for the scholar to run Tesserae search on a personal database.\nIn order to make this possible, I created a wrapper for the frontend, backend, and API in electron-js.\nDespite my previous dislike of the language, I took this opportunity to become more familiar with Javascript.\nMy attitude toward Javascript softened a little as a result of finally understanding how async and Promises are related.\nI also managed to package the Python code with PyInstaller so that the Python code could run on different operating systems.\nThere are some major discomforts on the initial use of the desktop application, given the long time it takes to download and install both MongoDB and the initial data for the database.\nIt was also hard to determine whether the desktop application really could run on multiple operating systems --- though I was able to verify that it worked on Ubuntu 20.04 and on Windows 10.\nMultitext\nOne final major contribution I made to the new Python code of the Tesserae project was implementation of what was called \"multitext search\".\nBecause Tesserae search can take a long time to complete, multitext search was developed by a previous generation of the Tesserae project to find intertexts shared across multiple works.\nFirst, a normal Tesserae search is run between two works.\nThen, the results from the two works is used to look up only the matching words in the list of other works specified in multitext search.\nThis takes much less time to complete than running Tesserae searches between every pairing of works specified in a list.\nMy implementation of multitext search in the new backend utilizes Python's built-in version of sqlite to store SQL databases for each multitext-enabled work ingested into Tesserae.\nThese databases contain information about where each pair of words occurs in a work.\nThen, during multitext search time, my implementation queries the appropriate SQL databases for only the word pairs that occur in the results of the initial Tesserae search and collates the retrieved data.\nRetrospective\nOne of the biggest realizations I made in my work with Tesserae is that software development is a social activity.\nKnowledge must be passed down from one generation of maintainers to another for a project to survive.\nIn many ways, the lack of easy access to the minds of the earlier implementers was the impetus for my initial push towards rewriting the code.\nI had the pleasure of interacting with a number of earlier implementers a few times, and each time, I better understood more parts of the earlier code --- particularly in why they were written the way they were.\nStill, time had made even their recollections fuzzy so that in some ways, I knew the old code better than they did.\n","id":"https://nOkuda.github.io/tesserae/","title":"Tesserae"}},"docInfo":{"https://nOkuda.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://nOkuda.github.io/about/":{"body":64,"title":0},"https://nOkuda.github.io/car-doors/":{"body":596,"title":5},"https://nOkuda.github.io/ct-scanning/":{"body":454,"title":5},"https://nOkuda.github.io/masters-thesis/":{"body":843,"title":4},"https://nOkuda.github.io/participation-tracker/":{"body":664,"title":3},"https://nOkuda.github.io/tesserae/":{"body":1176,"title":1}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
