I am Nozomu Okuda, and this is a website to showcase some of my technical accomplishments.
My training is in applied machine learning, and my academic focus was in natural language processing.
I've completed a few data science projects, both individually and in teams.
I can write code and fix bugs; I also enjoy making code run faster.
My favorite moments are seeing how math and code come together to solve a problem.

You can find a sketch of my work history at <https://www.linkedin.com/in/nozomu-okuda>.

If you want to know how to pronounce my name, keep the syllables in mind: No-zo-mu.

* No - like the English word "no"
* zo - rhymes with "no"
* mu - like what a cow says, "moo"
